# IWF Youth Q-Score Integration - Implementation Guide

## Summary

You have successfully integrated the `youth_factors` table to calculate accurate Q-youth scores (ages 10-20) using age-specific multipliers from the USAW database.

## Changes Made

### 1. SQL Trigger Function Updated ✓
**File:** `migrations/update-iwf-youth-qscore-trigger.sql`

**Changes:**
- Updated `update_iwf_qpoints_on_change()` function
- For ages 10-20: Queries `youth_factors` table for age-specific multiplier
- Formula: `base_huebner_score * youth_multiplier`
- Falls back to base Huebner if multiplier not found

### 2. JavaScript Analytics Updated ✓
**File:** `scripts/production/iwf-analytics.js`

**Changes:**
- Made `calculateAgeAppropriateQScore()` async
- Made `enrichAthleteWithAnalytics()` async
- For ages 10-20: Queries `youth_factors` table asynchronously
- Falls back gracefully if database query fails
- Includes proper error handling with warning logs

## Next Step: Update Scraper Calls

The scraper now needs to handle async enrichment. You need to update calls to `enrichAthleteWithAnalytics()` to use `await`.

### Files to Update

1. **`scripts/production/iwf-results-scraper.js`** - Main scraper
   - Find where athletes are enriched with analytics
   - Change: `const enrichedAthlete = enrichAthleteWithAnalytics(...)`
   - To: `const enrichedAthlete = await enrichAthleteWithAnalytics(...)`
   - Make the function async if it isn't already

2. **`scripts/production/iwf-analytics.js`** - In module exports
   - The enrichment happens during import, should handle async naturally

### Example Update Pattern

**Before:**
```javascript
// In some athlete processing loop
const enrichedAthlete = enrichAthleteWithAnalytics(athlete, meetInfo);
processedAthletes.push(enrichedAthlete);
```

**After:**
```javascript
// In some athlete processing loop
const enrichedAthlete = await enrichAthleteWithAnalytics(athlete, meetInfo);
processedAthletes.push(enrichedAthlete);
```

**For async loops:**
```javascript
// Before
athletes.forEach(athlete => {
    const enriched = enrichAthleteWithAnalytics(athlete, meetInfo);
    results.push(enriched);
});

// After
for (const athlete of athletes) {
    const enriched = await enrichAthleteWithAnalytics(athlete, meetInfo);
    results.push(enriched);
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Apply SQL Migration
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Copy entire contents of: migrations/update-iwf-youth-qscore-trigger.sql
2. Paste into SQL editor
3. Execute
```

### Step 2: Update Scraper Code
Search for calls to `enrichAthleteWithAnalytics` and add `await`:
```bash
grep -r "enrichAthleteWithAnalytics" scripts/production/
```

Add `await` before each call and ensure containing function is `async`.

### Step 3: Test the Changes

Test with event containing youth athletes:
```bash
# Single youth athlete test
node scripts/production/iwf-main.js --event-id 661 --year 2025 --limit 3

# Verify q_youth is populated with multiplier applied
sqlite3 supabase_db.db "SELECT lifter_name, age, q_youth FROM iwf_meet_results WHERE competition_age >= 10 AND competition_age <= 20 LIMIT 5;"
```

### Step 4: Backfill Existing Records (Optional)
If you have existing youth athlete records:
```bash
node scripts/maintenance/backfill-iwf-analytics.js
```

## How It Works

### Database Tier (PostgreSQL Trigger)
```
INSERT/UPDATE event → Trigger fires
  ↓
  Loop up youth multiplier from youth_factors for ages 10-20
  ↓
  Apply: q_youth = base_huebner * multiplier
  ↓
  Store in database
```

### JavaScript Tier (Async Enrichment)
```
Raw athlete data → enrichAthleteWithAnalytics()
  ↓
  For ages 10-20: Async query to youth_factors
  ↓
  Apply: q_youth = base_huebner * multiplier
  ↓
  Return enriched athlete data
```

## Fallbacks & Error Handling

Both tiers include fallbacks:

**Database (SQL):**
- If multiplier query fails → use base Huebner formula
- If youth_factors table missing → calculates using base Huebner
- No calculation errors, graceful degradation

**JavaScript:**
- If Supabase query fails → use base Huebner formula
- Logs warning: "Could not fetch youth multiplier for age X"
- Returns valid result even on database error

## Q-Youth Calculation Details

### Youth Multipliers (from youth_factors)
- Each age (10-20) has gender-specific multipliers
- Multipliers adjust base Huebner score for youth development
- Formula: `base_score * multiplier`
- Example: Age 15 boy with base score 300.5 and multiplier 1.05 = 315.525

### Age Categories
- **Ages ≤9:** No Q-scoring (returns all nulls)
- **Ages 10-20:** q_youth only (with multiplier)
- **Ages 21-30:** qpoints only (no age adjustment)
- **Ages 31+:** q_masters only (no age adjustment)

## Consistency with USAW

Both databases now use identical:
- ✓ Huebner base formula
- ✓ youth_factors multipliers
- ✓ Age bracket definitions
- ✓ Fallback behavior

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SQL migration applied successfully
- [ ] Scraper updated to use `await enrichAthleteWithAnalytics()`
- [ ] Import succeeds without errors
- [ ] Youth athletes (ages 10-20) have q_youth populated
- [ ] q_youth values differ from base Huebner (indicating multiplier applied)
- [ ] Non-youth athletes unaffected (qpoints/q_masters/null as appropriate)
- [ ] Backfill script updates existing youth records

## Troubleshooting

### q_youth still showing null?

1. **Check youth_factors table exists:**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM youth_factors;
   ```

2. **Check athlete has valid age and gender:**
   ```sql
   SELECT lifter_name, competition_age, gender, body_weight_kg, total
   FROM iwf_meet_results
   WHERE competition_age >= 10 AND competition_age <= 20 LIMIT 3;
   ```

3. **Check trigger function executing:**
   - Look for "Warning: Could not fetch youth multiplier" in logs
   - This means query failed but fell back to base Huebner

### Scraper erroring with async?

Make sure:
1. Function calling `enrichAthleteWithAnalytics` is marked `async`
2. Using `await enrichAthleteWithAnalytics(...)`
3. Not mixing callback-style with async/await

### Performance Issues?

If scraper seems slow:
- Q-youth lookup adds 1 database query per youth athlete
- Expected: minimal impact on speed
- Consider batch lookups if performance critical
